        <p class="description">This Crab Rangoon is said to be the closest to the rangoon served at certain Asian food chains. This favorite appetizer can also be deep-fried instead of baked.</p>
        <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can crab meat, drained and flaked</li>
            <li>2 green onions with tops, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
            <li>28 wonton wrappers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list description">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Combine cream cheese, crab meat, green onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>To prevent wonton wrappers from drying, prepare only one or two Rangoon at a time, keeping the other wrappers under a damp towel. Place 1 teaspoon crab filling onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Moisten edges with water and fold wrapper diagonally to form a triangle, pressing edges to seal and pressing out any air pockets. Moisten one of the bottom corners. Create a crown by pulling both bottom corners together and sealing. Repeat with remaining wonton wrappers and crab filling.</li>
            <li>Arrange Rangoon on the baking sheet and lightly spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
